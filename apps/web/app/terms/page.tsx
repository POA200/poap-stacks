            </h2>
            <p>
              POAP on Stacks is a decentralized platform that enables users to
              create, distribute, and collect Proof of Attendance Protocol
              (POAP) badges as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Stacks
              blockchain. All transactions are executed on the Stacks
              blockchain, which settles on Bitcoin.

              Event organizers retain all rights to the content, images, and

              you grant the Service a non-exclusive license to display and

              Users who receive POAP badges receive ownership of the NFT as
              recorded on the blockchain, but this does not transfer
              intellectual property rights in the underlying artwork or content.

              construed as financial, investment, or legal advice. You
              acknowledge that NFTs may have no monetary value and their value,
